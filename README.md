OpenJam 2020 project - catch, breed, sell Butterflies for profit!

The player can catch butterflies in a jar, and release them to cross-breed and increase their complexity.

Selling your creations increases the score based on their desirability.

Inventory is limited, so you need to manage your collection for maximum returns.

# How to play
Click on a butterfly (if you can!) and then an empty jar to catch it.

Click on a filled jar and then the $ symbol to sell the butterfly.

Click on a filled jar and then the "!" symbol to free the butterfly.

Butterflies will breed once free if they encounter a suitable mate.
